# MTA CCTV System Deployment Analysis

## 📌 Purpose of the Project

This project is aimed at analyzing the NYC Transit Subway Entrance and Exit Data to develop an efficient CCTV deployment plan. The main objectives are:

- To identify high-traffic subway stations that require enhanced CCTV coverage.
- To analyze accessibility (ADA) coverage across various divisions.
- To provide recommendations for network communication planning based on the analysis.
